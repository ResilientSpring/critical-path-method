# Critical Path Method

- The [Critical Path Method (CPM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_path_method) is an algorithm for scheduling a set of project activities.[1] It is commonly used in conjunction with the program evaluation and review technique (PERT). A critical path is determined by identifying the longest stretch of dependent activities and measuring the time required to complete them from start to finish.

- This program helps to demonstrate the Critical Path Method's algorithm using C++.
